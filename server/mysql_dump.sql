INSERT INTO prompts VALUES(2,'Environmental Protection','The government should invest more money in environmental protection rather than in economic development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?',replace('The government should invest more money in environmental protection rather than in economic development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nThere is ongoing debate about whether governments should prioritize environmental protection over economic development. While some argue that economic growth should take precedence, I strongly believe that environmental protection is equally important and should be given equal consideration.\n\nThose who favor economic development argue that it provides jobs, raises living standards, and reduces poverty. Developing countries need economic growth to improve infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Furthermore, economic development can fund environmental initiatives once countries become wealthier. For example, many developed nations began serious environmental protection only after achieving economic prosperity.\n\nHowever, I believe environmental protection should not be sacrificed for economic growth. Firstly, environmental degradation has serious long-term consequences. Climate change, deforestation, and pollution threaten human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. The costs of environmental damage often outweigh the benefits of short-term economic gains. Moreover, sustainable development is possible through green technologies and renewable energy, which can create jobs while protecting the environment.\n\nFurthermore, environmental problems do not respect national borders. Actions in one country can affect global climate patterns and ecosystems. International cooperation is essential, and wealthy nations have a responsibility to help developing countries adopt sustainable practices.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic development is important, it should not come at the expense of environmental protection. Governments should pursue sustainable development that balances economic growth with environmental stewardship.','\n',char(10)),'task2','medium','Environment',250,40,1,'2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00','2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00');

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nThere is considerable debate about whether computers and the internet are more important than traditional schooling for children''s education. While technology offers numerous advantages, I believe that school teachers remain essential for effective learning.\n\nOn one hand, computers and the internet provide access to vast amounts of information and learning resources. Children can learn at their own pace through interactive online courses and educational websites. Technology also offers personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual needs. Moreover, online education can be more cost-effective and flexible, allowing students to study from anywhere at any time.\n\nHowever, traditional schooling with teachers offers irreplaceable benefits that technology cannot provide. Teachers offer guidance, motivation, and emotional support that are crucial for children''s development. They can identify when students are struggling and provide personalized attention. Furthermore, schools teach important social skills and foster interaction between students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn my view, the most effective education combines both approaches. Technology can enhance traditional learning by providing additional resources and interactive tools. Teachers can use computers to create engaging lessons and help students develop digital literacy skills. The ideal system integrates technology as a tool to support, rather than replace, traditional teaching methods.\n\nTo conclude, while computers and the internet offer valuable educational opportunities, school teachers play an irreplaceable role in children''s learning. The best approach combines the strengths of both traditional and digital education.','\n',char(10)),'task2','hard','Education',250,40,1,'2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00','2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00');

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nThe chart illustrates the proportion of households living in owned and rented accommodation in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. Overall, the percentage of owner-occupied homes increased significantly over the period, while rented accommodation declined considerably.\n\nIn 1918, approximately 23% of households owned their homes, compared to 77% who rented. This trend reversed dramatically over the next century. By 2001, owner occupation had risen to 69%, while private renting had fallen to 10%. Social renting (from local authorities or housing associations) peaked at around 29% in 1981 but declined to 17% by 2011.\n\nThe most striking change occurred in owner occupation, which grew steadily from 23% in 1918 to reach a peak of 70% in 2001, before slightly declining to 65% in 2011. This increase was largely at the expense of private renting, which fell from 77% in 1918 to 17% by 2011.\n\nSocial renting showed more fluctuation, starting at zero in 1918, rising to 29% by 1981, then declining to 17% by the end of the period. This pattern reflects changes in government housing policies and economic conditions over the decades.\n\nIn summary, the data shows a clear shift from renting to owner occupation in England and Wales over nearly a century, with owner occupation becoming the dominant form of housing tenure by the early 21st century.','\n',char(10)),'task1','medium','Housing',150,20,1,'2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00','2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00');

Those aged 65 and over had the lowest usage, starting and ending at 0%.\n\nThe bar chart reveals that online shopping also grew significantly, though at a slower pace. In 1994, only about 2% of Australians purchased goods online. This figure rose gradually to 5% in 1997, then more steeply to 15% in 2000. By 2003, online shopping had reached 25%, and it continued to climb to 35% in 2006 and 45% in 2009.\n\nOverall, both internet usage and online shopping increased substantially in Australia from 1994 to 2009, with younger people adopting the technology much faster than older generations, and online commerce growing more slowly but steadily.','\n',char(10)),'task1','hard','Technology',150,20,1,'2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00','2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00');
INSERT INTO prompts VALUES(6,'Work-Life Balance','Many people find it difficult to balance work and other parts of their lives. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to help people achieve a better work-life balance?',replace('Many people find it difficult to balance work and other parts of their lives. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to help people achieve a better work-life balance?\n\nAchieving a healthy work-life balance has become increasingly challenging in modern society. There are several reasons why people struggle with this balance, and various solutions can be implemented to address these issues.\n\nOne primary reason for the difficulty in maintaining work-life balance is the demanding nature of modern work environments. Many jobs require long working hours, overtime, and constant connectivity through smartphones and emails. For instance, professionals in high-pressure industries often work beyond regular office hours and remain accessible during weekends and holidays. This constant availability blurs the boundaries between work and personal life, leaving little time for relaxation and family activities.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the competitive job market and economic pressures. In many countries, job security is not guaranteed, leading people to work harder to maintain their positions. Additionally, the rising cost of living forces many individuals to take on multiple jobs or work extended hours to meet financial obligations. This economic necessity often comes at the expense of personal well-being and family time.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of work itself has changed with the advent of technology. Remote work and flexible schedules, while offering some benefits, can make it harder to disconnect from work responsibilities. The ability to check emails and respond to work-related messages from anywhere can lead to work encroaching on personal time.\n\nTo address these challenges, several measures can be taken. Firstly, employers should promote flexible working arrangements, such as part-time options, job sharing, and remote work policies that allow employees to better manage their time. Secondly, companies should implement strict policies regarding work hours and after-hours communications to prevent burnout and ensure employees have adequate rest time.\n\nAdditionally, governments can play a role by enacting legislation that protects workers'' rights to disconnect and maintain reasonable working hours. For example, some European countries have introduced "right to disconnect" laws that prohibit employers from contacting employees outside of agreed working hours.\n\nOn a personal level, individuals should learn to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. This might involve turning off work notifications during personal time, delegating tasks when possible, and making time for hobbies and family activities.\n\nIn conclusion, while modern work demands and economic pressures make work-life balance challenging, a combination of organizational policies, government regulations, and personal discipline can help individuals achieve a healthier balance between their professional and personal lives.','\n',char(10)),'task2','easy','Work',250,40,1,'2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00','2025-12-16 17:16:38.273 +00:00');
INSERT INTO prompts VALUES(7,'Global Warming Solutions','Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing humanity today. Discuss the causes of global warming and suggest some solutions.',replace('Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with global warming threatening ecosystems, economies, and human livelihoods worldwide. This essay will examine the primary causes of global warming and propose practical solutions to mitigate its effects.\n\nThe main cause of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), from human activities. The burning of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes accounts for approximately 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also contributes significantly, as trees that would normally absorb CO2 are removed, reducing the planet''s capacity to sequester carbon.\n\nAnother significant contributor is agricultural practices, including livestock farming which produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Land use changes, such as the conversion of forests to agricultural land, further exacerbate the problem by reducing natural carbon sinks.\n\nTo address these challenges, several solutions can be implemented at individual, national, and international levels. Governments should invest heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This requires not only technological development but also policy changes, including subsidies for renewable energy and carbon pricing mechanisms that make fossil fuels more expensive.\n\nInternational cooperation is crucial, as climate change is a global problem requiring coordinated action. Agreements like the Paris Climate Accord provide frameworks for countries to commit to emission reductions, though stronger enforcement mechanisms are needed.\n\nOn an individual level, people can reduce their carbon footprint by conserving energy, using public transportation, eating less meat, and supporting sustainable products. Businesses should adopt sustainable practices, such as reducing waste and implementing energy-efficient technologies.\n\nTechnological innovations offer hope for the future. Carbon capture and storage technologies could remove CO2 from the atmosphere, while geoengineering solutions might provide temporary relief. However, these should be viewed as complementary to, rather than replacements for, emission reduction strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the causes of global warming are largely human-induced, the solutions lie in our ability to implement sustainable practices, embrace renewable technologies, and foster international cooperation. The time to act is now, before irreversible damage is done to our planet.','\n',char(10)),'task2','medium','Environment',300,45,1,'2025-12-17 08:00:56','2025-12-17 08:00:56');
